- Arrays.fill(name_arr, 'g') : Used in a char array to fill the array with some initial value.
- String.valueOf(arr) : Converts a character array to a String value.
- str.indexOf() : This function not only helps in finding the index of a character but also the index of any substring. For e.g if we have to find index of "te" in "attention", then the index = 2. This is useful in prefix/substring/postfix comparison questions.
- stack.toString() : Can also convert stack elements to a string.
- In stack questions where we have to pop any element, first check whether the stack is non-empty. If it is empty then generally push the element otherwise check condition and do accordingly.
- Integer.parseInt(str, 2) : If want to convert binary to decimal, first convert the number into a string. Then, use this where 2 represents the base in which the string is present. Can also be used with hexadecimal numbers (with base 16).
- For hashset, we cannot loop through the elements using indices. We can only loop using for(Wrapper_Class x: hashset).
- str.toCharArray() : When using char in a string, first convert it into a char array. Works faster.
- str.toLowerCase() : Converts whole string to lowercase but the process takes time.
- Character.isLetterOrDigit(ch) : Checks whether a character is alphanumeric or not.
- new String(charArray) : To sort a string, first convert the string into a char array. Then sort it using Arrays.sort(charArr). Then convert it into the string using new String function.
- set1.equals(set2) : to compare two hashsets
